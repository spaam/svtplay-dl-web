### Example configs:

#### simple
This will output all files to the folder `~/grejgrej/` in your home directory
```yaml
default:
  path: ~/grejgrej
```

#### service
This will output all files to the folder `~/grejgrej/` in your home directory. if downloading a video from dplay. it will use `user@example.tld` as username and `superHemligt` as password
```yaml
default:
  path: ~/grejgrej

service:
  dplay:
    username: user@example.tld
    password: superHemligt
```
Downloading a video from svtplay will save the file to `/storage/video/svtplay`, it will exclude every file with `a` or `b` or `c` in the name and if the quality is between 837 and 1837. it will write a filename without the id number in it.
```yaml
default:
  path: ~/grejgrej

service:
  svtplay:
    path: /storage/video/svtplay
    exclude: a,b,c
    quality: 1337
    flexibleq: 500
    filename: "{title}.s{season}e{episode}.{episodename}-{service}.{ext}"
```

This will download all episodes with subtitles and audio merged in to the video, sort them in to subfolders within ~/svtplay-dl and finally write the file name without the service attached.
```yaml
  default:
    path: ~/svtplay-dl
    subtitle: true
    merge_subtitle: true
    all_episodes: true
    subfolder: true
    filename: "{title}.s{season}e{episode}.{episodename}.{ext}"
```
